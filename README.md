# StarLink

The project likely has a web interface where users can interact with the satellite tracking dashboard. The interface includes a world map that shows the positions of the Starlink satellites in real-time. Users can click on a specific satellite to display additional information about it, they can also refine their search for specific satellites using a selector which implemented by ReactJS that creates a set of dropdown menus that allow users to select their desired location, altitude range, and duration range.
